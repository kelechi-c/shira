I initially had this idea to reproduce Shazam, after my experimental library for image retrieval, **ripple**.
However, as always, I dropped it. But I picked it up again, cus my current mission was **'model bending'**
In other words, using pretrained models to achieve other awesome stuff, since I didn't really have the compute to train my models.

I was also inspired by **@drmaxx**, a senior ML engineer(ex-**Stability**), to *glue models together*  to do other amazing stuff.

Anyways, I started this project on [06-10-24] (a day before my exams), let's see how it goes
