### .../dev notes for wavsearch


I initially had this idea to reproduce **Shazam**, after my experimental library for **image retrieval**, **[ripple](https://github.com/kelechi-c/ripple_net)**.
However, as always, I dropped it. But I picked it up again, cus my current mission was **'model bending'**,
in other words, using **pretrained models** to achieve/build other awesome stuff, since I didn't really have the **compute** to train my models.

I was also inspired by **@drmaxx**, a senior ML engineer(ex-**Stability**), to **_glue models together_**  to do other amazing stuff.

Anyways, I started this project on [06-10-24] (a day before my exams), let's see how it goes :)

- [**07.10.24**] -  started off with basic audio processing utilities
- [**08.10.24**] -  wrote class/function for **audio embeddings/clap processing**, some other sandbox code.
